h1. Todo List - Scaffold Cucumber Exploration

This is a simple todo list built with Ruby on Rails scaffold.  Most of the effort has gone into
building a nice set of cucumber tests for the scaffold, which (with some more effort) could be
generated along with the scaffold.

The only interesting stuff in here is in the features directory.
